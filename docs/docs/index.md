# File Sync
A simple unsecure way of syncing your files between your GNU/LINUX compliant OS's ;D

!!! warning
    READ THIS:
    For the love of god, in current state don't use this with files that are of great security: ID card images(don't do it in general), banking records, those neat Lockheed Martin classified documents, or other files that may impose any kind of damage if exposed to the public
## Idea
It just works
